This repo containing the sources of the Harmony Hub App for Athom's fantastic [Homey](http://www.athom.com) product.

### 1. On your Homey's interface go to "Setting > Apps" and find and install the Harmony Hub app

### 2. Go to settings and configure your Harmony Hub's IP address

### 3. Create a new flow using one of the Harmony Hub cards

If you skip step 2. or the IP address of your Harmony Hub changes later, obviously flows using this app's cards will not (or no longer) work. 
Just go back to step 2. to reconfigure your Harmony Hub's IP address.

Kudo's for the node.js lib to talk to the Harmony Hub go to [@swissmanu](https://github.com/swissmanu).
